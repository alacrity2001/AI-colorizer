# AI-Colorizer

In the final months of my highschool, I had been experimenting with deep learning method of colonizing art. The process involved create a rough color hint, cleaning it up into line art, and use GAN to finally color and shade to create a final product. The code was in my previous account(created by my highschool email), which was unfortunately lost after my highschool email being disabled. Here I posted them again.
