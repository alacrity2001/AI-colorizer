# Deep Colorblind

In the final months of my highschool, I had been experimenting with deep learning method of colonizing art. The process involved create a rough color hint, cleaning it up into line art, and use GAN to finally color and shade to create a final product. The code was in my previous account(created by my highschool email), which was unfortunately lost after my highschool email being disabled. Here I posted them again.

These are some of the posters we displayed at Senior night. And a photo of project, filled with picture generated by the AI, was taken.

## Setup

### Prereqs
    - Python 3.7, numpy
    - Tensorflow 0.12
    - OpenCV

### Running it
1. make a folder called "results"
2. make a folder called "imgs"
3. Fill the "imgs" folder with your own .jpg images, or run "download_images.py" to download from Safebooru.
4. Run "python main.py train". I trained for ~20 epochs, taking about 16 hours on one GPU.
5. To sample, run "python main.py sample"
6. To start the server, run "python server.py". It will host on port 8000.

### Pre-trained
The weights were unfortunately lost with my gaming laptop at somewhere in LA laptop. Since I was training with a GPU(which my previous Nvidia 1070 can easily do the job), I won't dare to train it again with my poor macbook now.
